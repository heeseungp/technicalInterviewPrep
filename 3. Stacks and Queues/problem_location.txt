3.1 Three Stacks in One Array 
	1st Solution: All same size stacks		
		./3_1/cpp/FixedStack.h
		./3_1/cpp/FixedStack.cpp
	2nd Solution: All stack sizes can be different, but all stack sizes must be within array size since we are using static sized array (no vector)
		./3_1/cpp/DynamicStack.h 
		./3_1/cpp/DynamicStack.cpp


3.2 Stack Min
	./MinStack.h
	./MinStack.cpp		


3.3 Stack of Plates
	./SetofStacks.h
	./SetofStacks.cpp
